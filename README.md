# Motion-Simulator
Simple Simulation written in pygame to demonstrate Newton's Three Laws of Motion.

# Controls
For the White Cube, W is forward and E is backward. 
For the Red Cube, Up Arrow is forward and Down Arrow is backward.

# Run
The code will automatically install pygame, so there is no need to install it.
The "convert_to_exe.py" file is for converting the game into an executable using py2exe, if that's what you prefer.
