# Motion-Simulator
Simple Simulation written in pygame to demonstrate Newton's Three Laws of Motion.
**NEWTON'S THREE LAWS OF MOTION:**
  1. An object will not change its motion unless a force acts on it.
  2. The force of an object is equal to the mass times its acceleration.
  3. When two objects interact, they apply forces of equal magnitude to each other in the opposite direction.
# Controls
For the White Cube, W will apply a force of 20 Newtons forward while E will apply a force of -10 Newtons. 
For the Red Cube, Up Arrow will apply a force of 20 Newtons forward while Down Arrow will apply a force of -10 Newtons. 

# Run
The code will automatically install pygame, so there is no need to install it.
The "convert_to_exe.py" file is for converting the game into an executable using py2exe, if that's what you prefer.
